\section{Introduction}
The main goal of this project is to generate concise and meaningful summaries from longer product reviews, while preserving the original meaning of the text.\\
The project is structured in the following phases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Collection and Preparation:} selection and preprocessing of a dataset of product reviews, with particular attention to text cleaning and normalization.
    \item \textbf{Design and Implementation of Neural Network Architectures:} study and development of models based on attention mechanisms for text summarization.
    \item \textbf{Training and Inference:} implementation of pipelines for model training and for performing summarization operations on new texts.
    \item \textbf{Experimental Evaluation:} comparative analysis of model performance using standardized metrics, in order to identify optimal solutions.
\end{itemize}
This document aims to illustrate the design choices and methodologies adopted for the realization of the project, as well as the experimental results obtained.
\textit{Text-Summarizer} is a Python framework for \textbf{automatic text summarization}, designed to be \textit{modular and easily extensible}.

\subsection{Project Structure}
The project is structured into several sections, each addressing a specific aspect of the work carried out.\\
The main folder contains the files and directories necessary for the execution of the project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{architectures}: folder containing the implementations of the architectures of the automatic summarization models;
    \item \textbf{report}: folder containing the final report of the project;
    \item \textbf{results}: folder containing the results obtained during the training and evaluation of the models;
    \item \textbf{\texttt{requirements.txt}}: file containing the libraries required for the execution of the project;
    \item \textbf{\texttt{text\_summarizer\_training.ipynb}}: Python notebook containing the code for training and evaluating the models;
    \item \textbf{\texttt{text\_summarizer\_inference.ipynb}}: Python notebook containing the code for model inference.
\end{itemize}
