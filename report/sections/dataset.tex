\section{Dataset}
For this project, the \textit{SNAP Amazon Fine Food Reviews} dataset\cite{datasetkaggle}\cite{datasetpaper} was used. It contains English-language reviews of food products from Amazon.\\
Specifically, the dataset includes, for each row, a full review and its corresponding summary.\\
From the original dataset, which consists of approximately 500,000 rows, a subset of 10,000 rows was selected for analysis and model training.
