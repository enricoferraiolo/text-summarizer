\subsection{Seq2SeqLSTMGlove}
The \texttt{Seq2SeqLSTMGlove} class implements an architecture similar to the Seq2SeqLSTM model, using pre-trained GloVe embedding vectors for word representation.\\
More precisely, pre-trained GloVe embedding vectors from \href{https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/}{Stanford NLP Group} with 100 dimensions are downloaded and used, although the class allows for easy swapping of vectors with those of different dimensions.\\
