# Text-Summarizer

## Overview

This repository is an academic project developed for the Natural Language Processing course 2024/2025. It focuses on building and evaluating models for text summarization, offering a comprehensive workflow that covers both training and inference processes.

## Key Components

### Project Purpose

The project explores techniques in text summarization. It leverages deep learning and attention mechanisms—critical components in modern NLP—to develop models capable of automatically summarizing text.

### Directory Structure

- **`architectures/`**: Contains different model architectures experimented with during the project.
- **`results/`**: Stores the trained models and their evaluation results, enabling performance tracking and comparison of different configurations.
- **`report/`**: Includes documentation and analysis detailing the project's methodology, experiments, and findings.

### Notebooks

- **Jupyter Notebooks:**
  - `text-summarizer_training.ipynb` – Notebook for training the models and evaluate their results.
  - `text_summarizer_inference.ipynb` – Notebook for performing text summarization on new inputs.
- **Python Scripts:**
  - `utils.py` – Provides utility functions to support data processing and other tasks.
